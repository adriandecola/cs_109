This directory contains my final project. This final project contains a front end, FauxtoShop.py, that works as a photo editing software for .ppm and .pgm files. This file was created by my professor Barry Lawson. I created methods for a class that held photo data to edit the photos. This file is what the front end used to edit the photos. Creating these mathods was truely enjoyable and I learned a lot. 

To run thise project, you can run the front end, FauxtoShop.py in any Python enviroment. After that, various photo editing tools can be tested under the Image tab. Edited photos can be saved under the File tab. In addition, different photos can be opened in the File tab.
